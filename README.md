## Vision Statement:

Connecting farmers with people. Better food to every table. Sourcing and deindustrializing the mainstream food market. More samples for consumers. Decrease the barriers to entry for quality foods.

## Motivations:

* To grasp the inner mechanics and integration of a webstore/online marketplace
* To expand our developer portfolios with a focus on marketplace technology and integration

## Risks:

* Pay per click API integrations
* Unfamiliar Technologies: Angular & React JS
* No prior team experience with each other
* Different time zones/release coordination
* Short timeline

## Mitigation Strategy:

* Free API trials/look for alternative APIs
* Decrease scope
* Integrate less features/user stories
* Minimize checkout system
* Stick to our AGILE project management guidelines/methodology

## Development Method:

* AGILE: SCRUM & KANBAN (via freedcamp)
* Discord for quick messaging
* Document deliverables
* Capture WBS via Kanban (Work Breakdown Structure)
* Plan sprints/milestones
* Track and report progress
* Github-Freedcamp integration
