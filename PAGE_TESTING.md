The home page is the first page users should be directed to when using our website. It contains banners at the top and bottom of the page that are

food product and links to a wish list and my cart page. The bottom banner has a picture of our website name/logo (Farmerize), our contact 
information (adress, phone, email) and a directory that links to other parts of the wbesite (about us, categories, my cart, my wish list

most of the bottom portion of this page is a list of products (updated regularly) for featured deals, most popular and highest rated.
