# Project Milestone 4: Web Pages Design


# Page 1:

Page Title: 

- Home Page

Page Description (include a mockup or hand drawn image of the page): 

- The home page is the first page users should be directed to when acessing the website. This page briefly communicates the mission of the platform and displays a snapshot of the types of products users can purchase.

- It contains banners at the top and bottom of the page that are consistent throughout the website. The top banner has a picture of the websites name/logo (Farmerize), a search bar to conveniently look for a desired food product and links to a wish list and my cart page. The bottom banner has a picture of the website name/logo (Farmerize), our contact information (adress, phone, email) and a directory that links to commonly visited pages (about us, categories, my cart, my wish list and my account). Occupying the top portion of this page is our mission statement as well as a subscription bar for users to enter their email adresses for future promotions. Occupying the bottom portion of this page are products categorised under featured deals, most popular and highest rated.
